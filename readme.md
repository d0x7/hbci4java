## Download

This fork is currently not in the Maven Central and probably will never be.

But you can still clone this repository and compile it yourself:

    $> git clone https://github.com/d0x7/hbci4java.git
    $> cd hbci4java
    $> mvn clean install
    
After that you can use it with maven like:

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.github.hbci4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>hbci4j-core</artifactId>
   <version>4.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
